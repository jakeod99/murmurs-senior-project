### Project Description
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - the variation in timing between heartbeats - is an indicator of cognitive, emotional, and biological regulation. HRV can be improved through HRV biofeedback, in which the subject participates in breathing exercises. The synchronization of breathing rate and heart rate at an individualized optimum resonant frequency often results in increased HRV. 
 
Our team is constructing a multi-platform mobile application that will coordinate with a wearable Polar® H10 Heart Rate Sensor via Bluetooth® to monitor a subject’s heart rate data. Based upon the data collected, the application will determine the subject’s HRV, and generate an optimal breathing exercise for the subject to follow along with. The application will be designed with a research environment in mind, and will collect biometric data for further analysis. That biometric data will be aggregated, stored on the cloud, and accessed for analysis via a web application interface which our team will also develop.
